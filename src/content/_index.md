**Software Crafter, currently senior consultant & co-CTO @ [Zenika Montr√©al](https://www.zenika.ca)**

I am a passionate developer for more than 13 years. Convinced that a working software is good but not enough, I work with my clients mainly as a Tech Lead in agile projects to build well-crafted softwares. I have worked as a Tech Lead for high stakes projects such as government websites or international sports tournaments websites.

I also like to share my knowledge and therefore I am a trainer on software development practices such as [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and I regularly present talks in meetups or in conferences such as [Devoxx France](https://www.devoxx.fr/). 

Finally, I am co-organizer of the [Software Crafters Montreal meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Software-Crafters-Montreal/) and co-founder of the [SoCraTes Canada conference](http://socrates-ca.github.io/).
