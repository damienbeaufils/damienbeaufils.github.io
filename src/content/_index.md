**Software Crafter & Director of Engineering @ [Kumojin](https://kumojin.com/)**

I am a passionate developer for more than 17 years. Convinced that working software is good but not enough, I work with my clients mainly as a Tech Lead in agile projects to build well-crafted software. I have worked as a Tech Lead for high stakes projects such as government websites or international sports tournaments websites.

I also like to share my knowledge and therefore I am a trainer on software development practices such as [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development), and I regularly present talks in meetups or conferences such as [Web À Québec](https://webaquebec.org/). 

Finally, I am a co-founder of the [SoCraTes Canada conference](https://socrates-ca.github.io/).

I can help you if you have one of these symptoms:
* Difficulties to add new features to an existing legacy codebase
* More time spent to fix bugs than to add new features
* No clear definition of what clean code or software quality are
* Not sure how to write good automated tests and which kind of tests you should write
* Too much technical debt
* Having still the same issues even when working on a codebase started less than 1 year ago
* Willing to create a well-crafted software that you won't throw away in 3 years
