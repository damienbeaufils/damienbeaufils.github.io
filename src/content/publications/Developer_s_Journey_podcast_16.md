« In this episode, I talked to Damien Beaufils, a french software craftsman working in Paris. Damien shared the experience he made on his current project ; how he helped his team focus on quality to improve the whole software. We talked about the different kind of tests, the test pyramid and Damien even shared a very good recipe on how to improve test quality in a legacy or project lacking tests. Nota: We unfortunately had a couple hickups toward the middle of the recording, but what Damien was saying is pretty clear anyway! »
